await twilio.messages.create({
  body: "Payment sent!", // Plain text only
  from: "whatsapp:+14155238886",
  to: "whatsapp:+1234567890"
});
```

  "text": "Send 5 PC to +1234567890",
  "chat": { "id": 123456789, "type": "private" }
}

// Rich responses with buttons
await bot.sendMessage(chatId, `✅ *Payment Sent Successfully!*
💰 *Amount:* 5 PC
👤 *To:* +1234567890
🔗 *Transaction:* \`0xabc123...\``, {
  parse_mode: 'Markdown',
