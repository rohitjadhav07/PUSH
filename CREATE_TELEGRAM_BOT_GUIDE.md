```

## 📝 Step 3: Choose Bot Name

Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/PushPayCryptoBot. You can now add a description, about section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of commands.

Use this token to access the HTTP API:

Keep your token secure and store it safely, it can be used by anyone to control your bot.
